### Federated Learning Implementations (Flower-based)

This repository aggregates minimal implementations of federated learning algorithms built on Flower (PyTorch) for quick start and comparison.

- `FedAvg/`: Minimal implementation of Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
- `FedProto/`: Minimal implementation of Federated Prototype Learning (FedProto)

Refer to each subdirectory `README.md` for installation and local simulation instructions.
